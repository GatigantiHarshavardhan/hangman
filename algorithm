Declare character arrays word and guess to store the word to be guessed and the user's guesses, respectively.
Declare integer variables i, tries, len, and found.
Prompt the user to enter the word to be guessed and store it in the word array.
Get the length of the word using the strlen() function and store it in the len variable.
Initialize the guess array with dashes to represent the unknown letters of the word.
Print the length of the word and the initial state of the guess array.
Loop while the user has not yet found the word and has not yet used up all their tries:
Prompt the user to enter a letter and store it in the letter variable.
Loop through each letter in the word to be guessed and compare it with the letter the user entered.
If the letter matches, set the corresponding letter in the guess array to the letter the user entered and set the match variable to 1.
If there were no matches, increment the tries variable and print a message to inform the user of the incorrect guess and the number of tries remaining.
If there were matches, check if the guess array is equal tothe word array. If it is, set the found variable to 1. If not, print a message to inform the user of the correct guess and the current state of the guess array.
After the loop, check the value of found. If it is 1, print a congratulatory message. If it is 0, print a message to inform the user of the correct word.
End the program.
